        <h2>Who are we?</h2>

        <p>
          ComSSA is the club that supports computing, computer engineering, and networking
          students at Curtin University. <br><br>

          Most of the time, committee members can be found within the 314 level 2 labs.<br><br>

          We provide a wide range of events and services for our members, such as academic
          assistance, social events, industry presentations, and free Microsoft software
          licences!<br><br>

          Membership is open to everyone, even if you’re not a student! <br><br>

          Being affiliated with the Curtin Student Guild also means that membership is
          free, if you have a voucher from the Guild diary.
